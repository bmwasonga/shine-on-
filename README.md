This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

## Logic

The project uses [READFILE](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/FileReader) to read the file in the browser.
the csv CSV can be uploaded and that provides the react function with the directory of the file.

An input feild(not functioning), was to be used to limit the number of displays that are to be displayed
